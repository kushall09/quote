This is a simple bash script i made to get some hacking related quotes whenever i open up a terminal ...

<i>p.s the quotes are taken from <a href="https://cybersophia.net/quotes/hacker-and-hacking-quotes-sayings/">here</a></i></br>

<i>?? -- I made this while learning web scraping using <a href="https://github.com/ericchiang/pup">pup</a></i>

<b>clone the repo , add the bash script { quote.sh } wherever you would like to store a globally executable binary ! and then add it into your .(bash/zsh/fish...)rc </b> and you are good to go :p
